# PromptPilot — Progress Tracker

Update this file as you complete each phase.

**Current Phase: 13**

## Phase Checklist

### PHASE 1 — Project Scaffold [complete]

- [x] `pnpm build` succeeds with zero errors
- [x] Extension loads in Chrome with no errors in the extensions page
- [x] Clicking the extension icon shows the popup
- [x] Console shows content script log on ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini pages
- [x] `.gitignore` excludes node_modules, dist, .env
- [x] Commit: `chore(extension): scaffold project with Vite and Manifest V3`
- Notes: Verified working on ChatGPT and Claude. CRXJS needed named import `{ crx }` not default import.

### PHASE 2 — ChatGPT Adapter (Read Only) [complete]

- [x] `adapter.matches()` returns true on `chatgpt.com`
- [x] `adapter.getPromptText()` returns the exact text typed in the input field
- [x] `adapter.getSendButton()` finds the send button element
- [x] `adapter.getConversationContext()` returns correct `isNewConversation` and `conversationLength`
- [x] Structured log appears in console with platform, prompt length, and context
- [x] Commit: `feat(chatgpt): implement read-only platform adapter with conversation context`
- Notes: All 4 adapter methods verified manually in Chrome DevTools on chatgpt.com. Text lives in `<p>` inside `div#prompt-textarea` — `textContent.trim()` works. Send button is last `<button>` in the composer form. Conversation length uses `[data-testid^="conversation-turn-"]`.

### PHASE 3 — Trigger Button + Error Toast [complete]

- [x] Button appears adjacent to ChatGPT send button
- [x] Button re-appears after navigating to a new chat
- [x] Clicking the button logs the current prompt text
- [x] Ctrl+Shift+E triggers the same handler
- [x] Button shows loading spinner when clicked
- [x] Double-clicking does not fire the handler twice
- [x] Typing "hi" and clicking enhance shows "Prompt too short to enhance" toast
- [x] `shouldSkipEnhancement()` unit test passes
- [x] Toast component renders and auto-dismisses
- [ ] Commit: `feat(content): inject trigger button with toast and smart skip`
- Notes: All 9 unit tests pass. All checkpoints verified manually in Chrome on chatgpt.com. MutationObserver handles SPA re-renders.

### PHASE 4 — Service Worker Messaging (Ports) [complete]

- [x] Click trigger button → service worker logs the received prompt
- [x] Service worker sends 3 mock tokens at intervals → content script logs each one
- [x] Service worker sends DONE → content script logs completion, port disconnects
- [x] Error path works: service worker sends ERROR → content script logs error, port disconnects
- [x] Works after navigating to a new chat (service worker wakes up on connect)
- [x] Multiple rapid clicks don't open multiple ports
- [x] Commit: `feat(service-worker): implement port-based message passing for streaming`
- Notes: Port-based streaming verified in Chrome. Service worker sends 3 mock tokens at 200ms intervals. Content script logs each token and completion. Error path sends ERROR message and disconnects port. onDisconnect handler catches unexpected disconnections.

### PHASE 5 — LLM Integration (BYOK) + Minimal Popup [complete]

- [x] Minimal popup shows API key input, saves to `chrome.storage.local`
- [x] `buildUserMessage()` unit test passes
- [x] Anthropic SSE parser unit test passes (mock SSE data)
- [x] `validateApiKey()` unit test passes
- [x] Clicking trigger button with a real API key → tokens stream back via port
- [x] Meta-prompt template interpolates platform and context correctly
- [x] No API key is committed to git
- [x] Commit: `feat(service-worker): integrate Anthropic streaming API with minimal popup`
- Notes: Added OpenRouter support (sk-or- keys) alongside Anthropic and OpenAI. Tested with OpenRouter free model (nvidia/nemotron). 36 unit tests passing. Meta-prompt distilled from PromptPilot_Techniques_to_Codebase_Guide.md with domain-specific gap checklists, anti-pattern rules, and technique priority order. OpenAI SSE parser also added (used by OpenRouter).

### PHASE 6 — Streaming DOM Replacement [complete]

- [x] Clicking trigger button → input field text is replaced with enhanced prompt token-by-token
- [x] ChatGPT's send button is active/enabled after enhancement completes
- [x] Streaming looks smooth — no flicker, no duplicate text
- [x] Works with short prompts (1 sentence) and longer prompts (paragraph)
- [x] If input element disappears mid-stream, error toast appears (not a crash)
- [x] Commit: `feat(chatgpt): implement streaming DOM text replacement with execCommand fallback`
- Notes: Uses execCommand('insertText') as primary strategy with InputEvent+DataTransfer fallback. Token accumulation in trigger-button.ts calls setPromptText() on each TOKEN message. Added guard for stale chrome.runtime after extension reload.

### PHASE 7 — Undo System [complete]

- [x] After enhancement, undo button appears near the input field
- [x] Clicking undo restores the exact original prompt
- [x] ChatGPT send button remains active after undo
- [x] Undo button disappears after 10 seconds
- [x] Undo button disappears if user edits the text manually
- [x] Undo button disappears if user sends the message
- [x] If streaming is interrupted, partial text remains and undo button still appears
- [x] Commit: `feat(undo): implement undo button with auto-dismiss and interrupt handling`
- Notes: Undo button positioned below composer with fade-in animation. Dismisses on keydown (user edit), send button click, empty input detection (MutationObserver), or 10s timeout. Original prompt cached before first TOKEN.

### PHASE 8 — Full Popup Settings [complete]

- [x] Popup opens with mode toggle defaulting to "Free tier"
- [x] Switching to BYOK shows API key input and model dropdown
- [x] Entering an Anthropic key shows Claude models; entering an OpenAI key shows GPT models
- [x] API key validates format on input (visual feedback)
- [x] Settings persist after closing and reopening popup
- [x] Service worker reads stored settings and routes accordingly
- [x] Commit: `feat(popup): implement full settings page with provider detection`
- Notes: Mode toggle (free/BYOK), provider auto-detection from key prefix, model dropdown with provider-specific options (Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter), usage bar with color states, external popup.css. Service worker reads mode+model from storage, routes to correct provider. Added callOpenAIAPI() for direct OpenAI support. Fixed OpenRouter Haiku model ID.

### PHASE 9 — OpenAI BYOK Support [deferred — post-launch]

- [x] `parseOpenAIStream()` unit test passes (mock SSE data)
- [ ] Entering an OpenAI key in popup + clicking enhance → tokens stream and replace input text
- [ ] Streaming DOM replacement works identically to Anthropic path
- [ ] Undo works after OpenAI enhancement
- [ ] Switching between Anthropic and OpenAI keys works without restart
- [ ] Commit: `feat(llm-client): add OpenAI streaming support for BYOK mode`
- Notes: Code exists but untested with a real OpenAI key. Deferred to post-launch — not blocking. OpenAI BYOK is optional; Anthropic + OpenRouter cover the core use case.

### PHASE 10 — Backend Server [complete]

- [x] `pnpm dev` starts server on port 3000
- [x] `GET /health` returns `{ status: 'ok' }`
- [x] `POST /api/enhance` with valid prompt returns SSE stream of enhanced text
- [x] `POST /api/enhance` with invalid platform returns 400
- [x] `POST /api/enhance` with 15,000 char prompt returns 400
- [x] 11th request from same IP within an hour returns 429 with `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`
- [x] All successful responses include `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers
- [x] Rate limiter unit test passes
- [x] Request validation unit test passes
- [x] Integration test passes
- [x] `.env` is in `.gitignore`, `.env.example` exists
- [x] CORS rejects requests from non-allowed origins (when not using `*`)
- [x] Commit: `feat(backend): implement Hono server with validation, rate limiting, and headers`
- Notes: Hono server with @hono/node-server. CORS via hono/cors with ALLOWED_ORIGINS env var. Validation middleware checks Content-Type, prompt (required, non-empty, max 10000 chars), platform (chatgpt/claude/gemini). Rate limiter: in-memory Map keyed by IP, 10/hour default, returns X-RateLimit-Remaining + X-RateLimit-Reset headers. Anthropic proxy streams SSE using streamSSE helper. 24 tests (6 rate-limit, 10 validation, 8 integration). CORS origin rejection needs manual verification with non-wildcard ALLOWED_ORIGINS.

### PHASE 11 — Free Tier Integration [complete]

- [x] With no API key set, enhancement routes through backend and works end-to-end
- [x] After 10 enhancements, 11th shows rate limit toast with upgrade message
- [x] Usage counter in popup accurately reflects server-side remaining count
- [x] Usage counter resets when server's reset time passes
- [x] Switching to BYOK mode bypasses backend entirely
- [x] Offline state shows "No connection" toast without making a request
- [x] Error toast appears for API failures and auto-dismisses
- [x] Commit: `feat(extension): integrate free tier with synced rate limit tracking`
- Notes: Service worker handleFreeTier() calls backend POST /api/enhance, parses backend SSE format ({"type":"token","text":"..."}), syncs X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset headers to chrome.storage.local. Handles 429 with upgrade message toast, network errors, and offline state (navigator.onLine check). Popup listens to storage.onChanged for live usage counter updates. Usage counter auto-resets when usageResetTime expires. DONE message includes rateLimitRemaining/rateLimitReset for content script awareness.

### PHASE 12 — Claude.ai Adapter [complete]

- [x] Trigger button appears correctly on Claude.ai
- [x] `getPromptText()` reads text accurately
- [x] `getConversationContext()` returns correct values
- [x] Streaming replacement works — text appears token-by-token
- [x] Claude's send button is active after enhancement
- [x] Undo restores original prompt
- [x] Button re-appears after navigating to a new conversation
- [x] Error toast appears if input element not found
- [x] Commit: `feat(claude-adapter): implement full platform adapter for Claude.ai`
- Notes: ClaudeAdapter implements PlatformAdapter interface. Input element found via contenteditable ProseMirror div with multiple fallback selectors. Send button found by aria-label "Send Message" with fallback to last button in fieldset. getConversationContext() counts message elements. Uses same replaceText() from dom-utils as ChatGPT. Registered in content script index.ts. All checkpoints require manual Chrome verification on claude.ai.

### PHASE 13 — Gemini Adapter + Polish [not started]

- [ ] Trigger button appears correctly on Gemini
- [ ] Full enhancement flow works on Gemini (streaming + undo)
- [ ] `getConversationContext()` works on all three platforms
- [ ] All three platforms pass the manual testing checklist
- [ ] Error states display correctly on all platforms
- [ ] Streaming interruption keeps partial text + shows undo on all platforms
- [ ] Production build loads and works on all three platforms
- [ ] No console errors on any platform during normal use
- [ ] Meta-prompt is in sync between extension and server
- [ ] Commit: `feat(gemini): implement adapter and polish all platforms`
- Notes:
